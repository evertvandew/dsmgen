# Model modelling tool

This demo creates a tool for editing the model specifications that the tool generator consumes.
It knows the details of the model specification, and can generate a specification file.

## Getting started

To generate + run this tool, execute the `run.py` command.
This will install all the relevant files into a `build` directory,
and start a web server that is listening to port 5003. Just point a browser to 
[http://localhost:5003/model_specification_client.html] and start modelling.
