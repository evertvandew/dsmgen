# Hierarchical Model

Entities in the hierarchical model can have a parent. This determines the position of the entity in the model.
Entities can also have an order number, which defines the order of the entities with the same parent.
Lower order number comes first.


# Representation of the hierarchical model in diagrams

Elements from the hierarchical model can be represented in diagrams. 
A representation can also have a parent, which is always another representation.
